### Motivation ðŸ’¡
As a student in a highly competitve and saturated field, I understand the challenges of standing out. Success in this industry relies on building connections with professionals and continuously seeking opportunities to expand your knowledge. Attending events is one of the best ways to achieve this, offering a chance to network, learn, and grow!

I developed **Event Crawler** to make finding tech events easier for students and professionals like me.
